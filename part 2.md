## 1. Namespaces in PHP

Namespaces in PHP help you organize your code and avoid name collisions, especially when your codebase grows or you’re using third-party libraries.

### How to Declare a Namespace

```php
<?php
namespace MyProject;

class MyClass {
    public function greet() {
        return "Hello from MyClass!";
    }
}
```

### Using Namespaces

```php
<?php
require_once 'MyClass.php';

use MyProject\MyClass;

$obj = new MyClass();
echo $obj->greet();
```

### Why Use Namespaces?

- Avoid naming conflicts when combining third-party libraries
- Better organization and structure for large projects

## 2. Traits in PHP

Traits are a mechanism for code reuse in single inheritance languages like PHP. Traits allow you to create reusable methods that can be included in multiple classes.

### Example of a Trait

```php
<?php
trait Logger {
    public function log($message) {
        echo "Log: " . $message;
    }
}

class Application {
    use Logger;

    public function run() {
        $this->log("Application is running.");
    }
}

$app = new Application();
$app->run();
```

### When to Use Traits

- To avoid duplicating code in multiple classes
- To group common functionality in one place

## 3. Autoloading Classes

Autoloading in PHP is the process of automatically including the necessary PHP files when a class is instantiated, rather than manually including them using `require_once` or `include_once`.

### PSR-4 Autoloading Standard

The most commonly used standard for autoloading in PHP is PSR-4. It allows you to autoload classes based on their namespace and file path.

```php
<?php
spl_autoload_register(function ($class) {
    include 'src/' . str_replace('\\', '/', $class) . '.php';
});

$myClass = new MyProject\MyClass();
```

### Why Use Autoloading?

- Reduces the need to manually include files
- Keeps your codebase cleaner and more organized

## 4. Exception Handling

Exceptions are used in PHP to handle errors that occur during the execution of a program. They provide a way to deal with errors without disrupting the flow of your program.

### Try-Catch Block

```php
<?php
try {
    // Some code that might throw an exception
    throw new Exception("Something went wrong!");
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo "Caught exception: " . $e->getMessage();
}
```

### Custom Exception Handling

You can also create your own exceptions by extending the base `Exception` class.

```php
<?php
class MyCustomException extends Exception {
    public function errorMessage() {
        return "Custom error: " . $this->getMessage();
    }
}

try {
    throw new MyCustomException("This is a custom exception.");
} catch (MyCustomException $e) {
    echo $e->errorMessage();
}
```

## 5. PSR Standards

PHP-FIG (PHP Framework Interoperability Group) has established several PSR (PHP Standard Recommendations) that provide guidelines and best practices for PHP code.

Some important PSRs include:

- **PSR-1**: Basic coding standard
- **PSR-2**: Coding style guide
- **PSR-4**: Autoloading standard

By following these standards, you ensure that your code is compatible with other PHP libraries and frameworks.
